# avax-tests
This repo is a sandbox where I can build and test smart contracts for AVAX C-Chain.

## Directories
- [test01](./test01) a simple web3.js program that sends test ETH from one account to another.
- [test02](./test02) a boilerplate example from the hardhat Quick Start guide
- [test03](./test03) a simple counter smart contract adapted from test02. Has tests, and was deployed to Fuji testnet.
- [test04](./test04) a JS app that interacts with the deployed Count contract.
